ABOUT:
This is a product management application that uses a SQL database to store information about products that are in stock. Product objects keep track of a product's name, number in stock, price, sku, and an id number that will be handled by the database.


HOW TO USE:
The application is console only. Enter the number of your menu selection and follow instructions. The AdjustStock option is made to decrease stock in the case of sales or increase stock in the case of deliveries. It can handle positive and negative integers. The app will create a .db file the first time it runs and your data will be stored there.
